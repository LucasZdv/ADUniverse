Tools to create user tool
Our application is built on top of python's dash package and dependencies, along with the folium library to visualize a map. The initial data set was all provided in csv format. The application is dependent on its connection to the database to operate. Currently, this is fulfilled by housing a local, accessible instance of the SQLite database. Once the application ensures a connection is viable, all relevant information is available through the customized API.
