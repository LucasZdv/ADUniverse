**Findings**

_What were the outcomes of your analyses?
What is your interpretation of those findings?_

One of the first objectives of this project was to understand the historical landscape surrounding ADU construction, including characterizing the neighborhoods and parcels in which ADUs had previously been built as well as the effects that building ADUs have on the market value and assessed value of the parcel.  This information is crucial in determining how and to whom the ADUniverse web application ought to be marketed.  The analysis is also instrumental in terms of highlighting measures that need to be taken by the city to supplement the informational capacities of the app, which includes creating partnerships with other city agencies engaged in housing affordability work, pursuing city subsidies to encourage ADU construction, and generating supplemental informational resources targeted to specific use cases.

Value-added analysis of parcels with and without ADUs was carried out using sale price and assessed value data from the King County Assessor’s office regarding single-family zoned parcels in Seattle between 1996 (the recorded ADU home sale) and 2018 (the last complete data cycle).  Preliminary descriptive analysis, illustrated by Figure [X] suggests that the value (both market and assessed) homes with attached and detached ADUs mirror (if not slightly exceeds) those  without.

Hedonic panel regression, controlling for all measured marketable housing criteria (i.e. home and lot square footage, bedrooms, building condition and age) reveals that these trends are only very recent.  There appears to be no statistically significant difference in sale price or assessed value between parcels with DADU and comparable parcels without until 2016.  The recent increases in value over comparables has abated slightly in the intervening years, but between 2017 and the present, home owners can expect to see an approximate 12-15% increase in the market value of their home.  These trends are illustrated in Figure [X] below:

Attached ADUs, on the other hand, are negatively associated with both market and assessed value relative to comparable homes.  Although the value gap has closed over time and continues to close, there is still a sizeable difference.  

Taken together, these findings indicate a continuing increase in the desirability of AADUs and DADUs for potential buyers, but they also suggest that interventions may be needed in order to more accurately approximate the value added to a parcel through ADU construction.  Qualitative evidence, for instance, points to the fact that neither private home appraisers nor county assessors have the frameworks or capacities to value ADUs.  Increasing communication and collaboration between Seattle Department of Planning and Community Development and the King County Assessor’s office to better quantify ADU value may ameliorate these issues and increase the profitability of ADU for the homeowners.
