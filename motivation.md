**Questions**

We hope to answer three questions through our work:

### 1) Where have ADUs been created historically?
  We do this by exploring characteristics of sites where AADUs and DADUs have been permitted to date (using City of Seattle permit data). This has to do with parcel-level physical characteristics (single-family zoned, size and width of the lot; size of existing house; access to street corners and alleys; year built; and placement on tree canopy, environmentally critical areas and steep topography), neighborhood-level demographic characteristics (median income, race), and median rent and home values.

### 2) What factors affect ADU feasibility, and how can we use this information to help a property owner understand his or her development potential and decide to proceed?
  We know that if the home is outside of a single-family zone, they would be informed, through our online tool, that they would not be eligible for the building of an ADU. Similarly, if their lot was less than 3200 square feet, they could not build a DADU. We will also provide warnings if their properties are placed on environmentally critical areas, steep slopes, have significant tree cover, invasive side sewers, unwieldy lot configurations or existing structures. We would then also help them see the financial viability of construction and loans and support in the permitting process and provide other resources.

### 3) Where should the City focus its programmatic strategies?
  The city will be able to use this historical model and tool to target certain areas most likely and potentially most able to build ADUs and encourage and incentivize them to build ADUs. They might finance ADU construction for low-income homeowners, or finance ADU renting for low-income renters, or connect homeowners interested in housing disadvantaged renters with potential qualified renters. This would be a part of the city's larger anti-displacement strategy to enable homeowners to stay in their homes and renters to live in previously-difficult-to-access neighborhoods.

We are filling the needs of users of all levels.
