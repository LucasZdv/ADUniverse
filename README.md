# ADUniverse

Auxiliary Dwelling Units (ADU) such as backyard cottages and in-house mother-in-law apartments provide a way for the City of Seattle to address housing affordability. This project is about aiding owners of single family homes to assess the eligibility and desirability of building an ADU. We illustrate our vision via a prototype software tool for homeowners. Further details are provided in a white paper.
