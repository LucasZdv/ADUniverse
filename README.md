# ADUniverse

Auxiliary Dwelling Units (ADU) ("backyard cottages") provide a way for the City of Seattle to address housing affordability. This project is about considerations made by owners of single family homes to assess eligibility and desirability for building ADUs. We illustrate our vision via a prototype software tool for homeowners, and provide details in a white paper.
